# ðŸŒ¸ Iris_AI ðŸŒ¸  
**Your Personal Iris Flower Detector**

Iris_AI is a deep learning-based model that classifies the species of Iris flowers based on four key measurements. The project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, trained on a custom Iris dataset available in this repository, to provide accurate species predictions.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Interactive AI Model**: Iris_AI uses a neural network to classify Iris flowers with high accuracy.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Architecture**: The model uses a dense neural network for effective feature recognition.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides predictions on Iris species based on four simple inputs: **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Running the Project Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RenoTxT/Iris_AI.git
   cd Iris_AI
   
2. **Install Dependency**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run The Notebook**:  
   Open the Iris_AI.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to start training and using the model.

<h2>Running on Google Colab</h2>
To run the project directly in Google Colab, click the badge above or this link. This link opens the Colab notebook where you can explore and train the model step-by-step.
<hr/>
<h2>Running on VS Code (Recommended)</h2>
To avoid certain warnings and errors that may appear when running the project from the Command Prompt, it is recommended to run the project in VS Code. You can follow the same steps as above, but instead of using the Command Prompt, use VS Codeâ€™s integrated terminal. This way, you can run the project smoothly without encountering issues related to warnings that may interfere with your experience.
<hr/>
ðŸŒ¼ Example Usage
After training, you can use the function predict_iris to make predictions. Simply input values to predict the Iris species:

python
```bash
# Example: Predicting Iris species based on measurements
predict_iris(5.8, 2.7, 4.1, 1.0)
# Output: Predicted species, e.g., "Iris-versicolor"

<hr/>
ðŸ“ˆ Training the Model
The model is trained using the following settings:

Model Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron with dense layers.
Epochs: 100 (can be adjusted as desired)
Batch Size: 16
Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001
Training metrics (accuracy and loss) are visualized to help assess model performance over time.
<hr/>
ðŸ“Š Visualizing Results
After training, the model's accuracy and loss are plotted for both training and validation data to show progress and convergence.
